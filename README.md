# JavaFiller2
Similar to JavaFiller but more complex so I made a new repository. It receives string inputs for before, after, and between and then prints your content with the values in their respective places as in JavaFiller. This version will also let you repeat something n times and print iterator values as well.
Attached are files "input.txt" and "output.txt" providing examples for input and output. The default I/O files are "input.txt" and "output.txt" but can be change with commandline arguments as in JavaFiller. To set values for before, after, and between use #before _string_, #after _string_, and #between _string_. To assign a value to an iterator use #assign _character_ _value_, to print a line without format use #print _string_, and to repeat something n times use #_numberOfTimes<string>_. You can use any value as an iterator, upper and lowercase(52 options). Any values can be changed at any time, and empty line are ignore.
